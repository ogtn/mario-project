<p>
Mario project is a 2D platform game, inspired by 16-bits platformers, such as Super Mario World. It aims to recreate the gameplay of SMW, with better graphics, and to provide tools to make new levels and enemis.<br />
This project should be able to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems, as it uses only pure C, OpenGL, SDL and Libxml2.<br>
<br>
<i>The project is stopped now because we think we need oriented-object to complete the game. So, we stop development of C version to develop a C++ version with SFML <a href='http://code.google.com/p/super-mario-project/'>here</a></i>
